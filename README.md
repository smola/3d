# 3d

This is my 3D design and printing playground.

## Models

Models are created using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), so they are source code files with `.scad` extension. [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) files are also provided with the result of rendering SCAD models with their default parameters. [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software) profiles for the Anycubic i3 Mega are also provided.

* Garden
  * [Vine lattice](garden/vine_lattice/README.md)

## Utilities

* [lib/lib.scad](lib/lib.scad): useful OpenSCAD functions.
